# Web app instructions

Read the root and affected dependency AGENTS.md files before changes. Keep documentation in English.

## Responsibility and structure

Next.js owns presentation and authentication transport. Hono in `workers/api` is the only
business API. All web API requests use the same origin and delegate through a Service Binding.
The web has no database, provider-secret, Mastra or infrastructure dependency. Public Supabase
Auth values are the exception: authentication uses its publishable key in the browser/callback.

```text
src/app/
  api/v1/[...path]/route.ts # Transport-only delegation; no business decisions
  auth/callback/route.ts    # Supabase code exchange, cookies, return to console
  console/page.tsx          # Private research UI
  (auth)/                  # Existing signup/signin design
  apply/                   # Creator application using API-backed cookie access
  agents/, tokens/, reads/  # Existing public demonstrations
src/features/console/      # Agent form, history, research result and API client
src/server/
  api-client.ts            # API Service Binding; explicit loopback-only next-dev fallback
  container.ts             # Typed presentation facade over HTTP DTOs
  http/apply-cookie.ts     # Read the incoming cookie for the application page
  http/auth-board.ts       # Presentation formatting only
```

Landing, signup, applications, token pages, paid reads, wallet and ranking designs are retained.
Public demo content comes from explicitly sample-labeled API endpoints; research results never
appear there automatically. `/api/v1/landing` keeps its polling behavior. Hono sets the HttpOnly,
Secure `pk_apply` cookie; the web only transports it. Never put that bearer token in URLs or JSON.

## Three-layer implementation example

For a new business operation, implement the domain rule/use case/port in `packages/core`, the
PostgreSQL/provider adapter in `packages/infrastructure`, and the Hono handler in `workers/api`.
Compose adapters in that Worker. Publish runtime-validated HTTP DTOs from `packages/api-schema`.
The web adds a form and calls `/api/v1/...`; it does not duplicate the authorization or use case.

```text
packages/core/src/features/example/          # Framework-free business operation and ports
packages/infrastructure/src/example/         # Concrete adapter with validated external data
packages/api-schema/src/example.ts           # Request/response wire contract
workers/api/src/routes/example.ts            # Verified actor, DTO parsing, use-case call
apps/web/src/features/example/               # Form, loading/error states and DTO rendering
```

This is a proposed example, not an existing example feature. Use public workspace exports,
never cross-package relative source imports. Server-only presentation facades remain protected
with `server-only`. ESLint disallows core/infrastructure imports throughout the web app.
Client validation improves feedback; API validation and core authorization remain authoritative.

## Commands and checks

Use root `npm run build:shared`, lint, typecheck, tests and build. `npm run dev` starts Next.js;
set the explicit loopback PICKLER_API_LOCAL_URL when using a separately running local API.
Public Supabase Auth values are supplied at build time. No provider or database credentials
belong in `.env` here. The final deployment must be tested using OpenNext/workerd, not only
next dev. Check cookies, protected routes, session refresh, signout and tenant isolation.

## Design system

Shapes, control sizes and button variants live in `@pickler/ui` (see its `AGENTS.md`): pill for actions and chips, 16 for cards, 12 for inputs and tiles, 6 for small marks. Feature stylesheets reference the `--pk-radius-*` tokens and never hard-code a radius. Each shell declares its surface: the landing, apply and public pages use `data-surface="public"`, the auth screens use `data-surface="console"`, which is the dashboard's tone. Type is the same on both: Chakra Petch for titles and the lead figure of a view, JetBrains Mono for tabular data and labels, Manrope for body text and every control.

Controls come from `@pickler/ui`: `Button`/`ButtonLink` for actions (`glow` is the lit marketing call to action — the hero, the waitlist, the application), `Chip` for filters and toggles (`ChipLink` when it navigates, `ChipText` when it only reads), `Segmented` for an exclusive choice that is always on screen, `Tag` for read-only status, `Meter` for a filled track, `Icon` for every icon. Feature stylesheets keep only what a control does differently and pass it through `className`; they do not re-declare shape, type or state. Colour is the same: each sheet aliases the system tokens (`--ink: var(--pk-ink)`) and holds no literal. Panels take the shared surface with `composes: pk-panel from global` instead of redeclaring a border and a radius.

Market data is drawn with `CandleChart` and `BarChart` from `@pickler/ui` — the price panel on a token page and every series under the leaderboard. Features hand them timestamped buckets and nothing else; colours and type come from the surface. The library's own logo is off, so `PublicShell` carries the TradingView credit its licence asks for; any new surface that shows a chart needs that credit too.

## The wallet

`features/wallet/` owns the connection: an EIP-1193 conversation with the injected wallet, no connector library. It asks for accounts, reads the chain and the native balance, follows `accountsChanged` and `chainChanged`, and offers to switch to Monad testnet using the metadata in `@pickler/chain`. It never signs or sends anything — connecting is a read that tells the site which address to show a portfolio and a read history for.

**Connecting is not signing in.** The creator account at `/signin` is for people building agents; the wallet is for people reading and backing them. Do not fold one into the other.

Three pages only mean something for a connected wallet — `/portfolio`, `/activity` and `/reads` — and they say so through `ConnectGate` rather than showing an empty table. Following an agent is kept in the browser against the address, so a different wallet in the same browser has a different list and nothing about it reaches a server.

What is real today: the address, the chain and the native balance. What is not: agent tokens, because the launcher contracts are not deployed, which is what the portfolio says instead of showing a zero. Paying for a read needs those contracts too, so the ask flow connects a wallet and then stops at a disabled Pay with the reason on it. The trade panel reads the same way: Connect wallet is live and lime, a wallet on the wrong network is offered the switch, and only once both are right does the button become the trade that the missing contract disables.

## One navigation bar

`features/site/site-nav.tsx` is the navigation for every public route, landing included: the same brand, the same Explore / Build / Resources menus, the same height. Only two things change. The landing hangs the price tape above it, and nowhere else does. The explore routes — everything inside `PublicShell` — also carry the wallet: CONNECT WALLET beside JOIN TESTNET, and once connected the address, its balance, and the three pages that only exist for it.

The apply flow and the auth screens keep their own bar on purpose — a flow that is asking for something should not offer six ways out of it — but the bar is the same height as the navigation and carries the same brand, so only the right-hand side differs. The brand mark is lit in cyan on every surface, the flows included. Lime stays for what the product does — a filled action, a win, a graduated token — not for who made it.

## Paid reads

An agent sells one thing publicly: a read. Someone picks one of its markets, pays, and gets back a probability with the reasoning, the sources and the limits under it. The question is never written by the person asking — every read asks whether the named market is above its price at delivery 24 hours later — which is what makes two answers comparable and an agent's record meaningful. `readQuestion` in core writes it; the DTO carries it so a page never re-derives it.

Two clocks run per read and they are separate in the UI as well as the data. Delivery is what the agent owes inside its stated window, and the money returns if it misses. Evaluation is what the market did afterwards; `not_evaluable` is an honest gap and counts neither way. Asking is violet everywhere it appears, so it never reads as backing the token.

Nothing charges yet: the pay button carries the note rather than pretending. A read is not a trading permission, and the copy says so on the review step and on the card.

## Dashboard and the public site

The dashboard for creators is built by the infrastructure owner on top of `apps/agent-service`; this branch owns the public surface: landing, `/apply`, the auth screens, `/tokens`, `/agents`, `/reads` and `/leaderboard`. Keep the two apart inside `app/`: public routes and `features/` folders here, dashboard routes in their own segment, and no shared component edited by both without saying so in this file.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Unified API transport and private console

`src/server/container.ts`
is now a typed API client facade. No core or infrastructure dependency is permitted anywhere
in this app. `src/app/api/v1/[...path]/route.ts` delegates requests through the API Service
Binding; the explicit loopback-only fallback is for local development. Cookies and JWT headers
are transported, never interpreted as workspace authority by the web Worker. Hono validates
identity and owns business decisions. Only public Supabase Auth configuration reaches the web.

`features/console` and `/console` provide private agent configuration, manual research, schedule
and pause controls, history and evidence. Reuse the existing shared control system with
`data-surface="console"`. API mutation errors remain explicit; do not automatically retry paid
research. Reuse an idempotency key after an uncertain admission response. Poll pending/active
research every three seconds, stop at terminal status, suspend in hidden tabs and clean up
requests/timers on navigation. Results are not added to the public sample directory.

The auth callback exchanges a Supabase authorization code and returns to the console. Console
onboarding finishes missing profiles and idempotently provisions a workspace. Provider access
remains operator-enabled, separate from authentication. The completed signup screen links to
the console; public wallet/token/read demonstrations retain their existing design and limits.
