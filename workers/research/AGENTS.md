# Research Worker

Read the root and packages/agent-runtime instructions first. This is the deployed Queue and
Cron host, distinct from the protected local experiment in apps/agent-service. Do not remove
that experiment's database/loopback guards. No HTTP handler, Studio, or tenant tokens here.

Use request-scoped PostgreSQL via cache-disabled Hyperdrive. Await one leased research per
Queue delivery, including heartbeat cleanup and database closure. Generic wakeup messages
never authorize a tenant. PostgreSQL controls admission, quotas, ownership and configuration.
No automatic paid retries; a redelivery can claim another queued run, never restart a running
or terminal research. Cron only reconciles durable jobs. Admission shutdown preserves data.

Use the shared runtime and prompts, not a duplicate model implementation. Do not seed lab
agents or change operator configuration during startup. Connection checks are explicit operator
commands. Credentials stay in Worker secrets. Production deployment is outside this release.

The staging Wrangler config caps Queue concurrency at five and reconciles every minute.
Build with `npm run build:worker --workspace=@pickler/research-worker`. The zero Hyperdrive ID
is for dry runs only; use the root staging checks and operations guide before any deployment.
