# Shared research runtime

Read the root and dependency AGENTS.md first. This package is the shared Mastra library
composition for local Node/Studio and the deployed Queue consumer. It is not an HTTP server.
Core owns policy and permissions; infrastructure owns providers and persistence. Never import
Next.js, dotenv, Studio, filesystem configuration or laboratory tokens. Startup must not seed
agents, change global configuration, or call providers. Provider checks are explicit operations.

Prompts retain immutable snapshots and versions when moved unchanged. Runtime tools obey the
same core guards, budgets, five-minute deadline and renewable per-run lease across hosts.
`composition/runtime.ts` builds real adapters; `workers/lease.ts` owns heartbeat cleanup;
`workers/background.ts` implements generic Queue wakeups and scheduled reconciliation.
No trading/signing tools or paid retries. Build shared dependencies before local consumers.
