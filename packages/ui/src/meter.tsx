/**
 * A filled track: progress along a bonding curve, a reputation score, a trait. It is a reading of
 * one number between 0 and 100, never a control and never a chart.
 *
 * Tone carries the meaning the surface already gives the figure beside it: lime for what landed or
 * graduated, amber for what is still on its way, magenta for what went against, cyan for neutral.
 * A meter that repeats a number already written next to it is decoration, so it is announced only
 * when it is given a `label`.
