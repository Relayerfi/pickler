# Infrastructure package instructions

Read [the root instructions](../../AGENTS.md) and [core instructions](../core/AGENTS.md) before changing adapters or their ports. Read any other affected project's local instructions and keep this file current.

## Responsibility and current state

`@pickler/infrastructure` implements interfaces owned by core. It exports `systemClock`, `ExaResearch` (`WebSearch`/`PageReader`), `PolymarketData` (`MarketData`) and `PostgresResearchStore` (scoped configuration, runs, evidence, decisions and job persistence). Constructors accept configuration; no credentials are embedded.

Actual adapters live in `src/research`, `src/polymarket` and `src/persistence`. Business policy comes from core; SQL implements transactional admission, idempotency, claims and scoped access. Drizzle defines tables in `src/persistence/schema.ts` and versioned SQL migrations in `drizzle/`. Admission, configuration, claims and scheduling lock agent rows in transactions. Never retry ambiguous research automatically. New providers must pass capability contract tests. Public runtime exports use compiled `dist`; relative source imports include `.js` extensions.

## Rules

- Depend on `@pickler/core` ports; never make core depend on this package.
- Keep provider SDK types, queries, protocol details, and technical response validation inside adapters. Return values matching business-owned interfaces.
- No Next.js, React, web app imports, HTTP response construction, or UI behavior.
- Accept validated configuration through constructors/factories. The application's protected composition root selects and instantiates adapters. Do not require Next.js-specific `server-only` inside this framework-independent package.
- Keep credentials out of public exports and logs. Consumers must protect server imports; do not expose this package through client barrels.
- Configure timeouts and normalize failures. Retry only safe or idempotent operations. Do not automatically retry ambiguous writes or transaction submissions.
- Verify provider webhook signatures at the appropriate integration boundary and support deduplication when such flows are introduced. Keep HTTP mapping in the app.
- Blockchain adapters may use public artifacts from `chain` after declaring that dependency. Business code must remain independent of the chosen blockchain SDK.
- Do not add placeholder adapters to claim that a provider is integrated.

## Checks

Run `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint` and `npm run build` from root. Tests in `test/*.test.ts` cover provider normalization/errors, PostgreSQL isolation/concurrency/recovery/schedules, and core research with injected providers. No paid calls occur in tests. Shared package builds precede runtime consumption. Use the private `pickler` schema; Mastra owns the separate `mastra` schema in the same PostgreSQL database. `@pickler/infrastructure/testing` is a test-only helper that creates and removes isolated databases; never import it from runtime code. Run `npm run db:up` before integration tests. Generate schema migrations with `npm run db:generate` and apply them explicitly with `npm run db:migrate`; startup must not migrate Pickler tables.

Decision v2 and uncertainty-policy settings use the existing JSONB columns; no database migration or historical backfill is required. Preserve old decision/config documents on reads. Policy updates use the existing versioned config transaction and disable scheduling. Integration tests verify proposal/final-verdict persistence, policy version snapshots and tenant isolation.

Provider HTTP calls use `redirect: "manual"` and reject all non-success responses, including redirects. This preserves credential isolation and works in both Node.js and Cloudflare Workers, which does not support the `error` redirect mode.

Execution uses `runs.lease_owner`, `runs.lease_expires_at` and the singleton `execution_policy` (defaults: global 5, tenant 2). Claims lock that policy row only for the admission transaction and choose the oldest eligible job. The per-agent running index remains authoritative. A store instance privately retains the random token for each claim; only that instance may renew or write for its claimed run. Public run projections exclude lease columns. Reservations last 60 seconds and hosts renew every 15 seconds.

Use PostgreSQL `clock_timestamp()` for expiration, never HTTP timestamps. The optional constructor lease clock is only injected by the test helper; runtime never accepts clock configuration. Event, renewal and finish operations lock/recheck the run atomically. Renewal errors revoke local ownership. Recovery affects only expired running jobs and preserves partial evidence. Migration 0001 interrupts legacy unleased running jobs while preserving queued/history records. Migration 0002 rejects upgrades while an old session owner exists and guards valid leases against legacy global recovery. Valid finalization sets a transaction-local owner token for that trigger. Stop every old executor before applying migrations; do not roll back to old binaries on the upgraded database.

Polymarket discovery round-robins a shared budget of five pages of twenty markets across configured categories. Preserve `gameStartTime` provenance, including explicit PostgreSQL timezone offsets; absent or ambiguous start times stay null. Never substitute opening or closing dates for sporting starts. Extract exact normalized public resolution URLs from description and resolution-source metadata. Core applies eligibility after discovery and selected-market refresh. Exa validates public source URLs and rejects mismatched read results.

`src/sports` implements BALLDONTLIE and The Odds API with validated structured evidence, bounded requests, permission-checked public caching and shared PostgreSQL quotas. Migration 0003 adds private cache/quota tables. Never put credentials in cache keys, source URLs or evidence. Preserve original retrieval/update timestamps. Atomic evidence and successful result writes also lock/check the current agent configuration.
